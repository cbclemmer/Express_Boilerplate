#bare express
  
This is a simple package with a simple job. Load it in, do  
`npm install`  
and it should work perfectly with node.js installed

##How to use
* npm install
* load html pages you want to render into the 'pages' folder
* run `sudo node app [PORT NUMBER]`. If the port number is not specified it defaults to 81
* open your browser to `[YOUR IP ADDRESS]:[PORT NUMBER]/[PAGE}`. After the backslash, input the html file name into the box without the `.html`. 
* EG: to see `index.html`, go to `www.mysite.com:81/index`

Simple, right? right.
